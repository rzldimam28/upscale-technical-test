# Upscale Technical Test
This repository contains my answer for the technical test at **Upscale.id**. This repository contains 6 different tasks + several problem solving questions. I have answer them in each folder that I named '1-7'. I also have created the unit test for each task for ensure the task has been 'tackled' properly.

## How to Run Test:
You can run the tests with `go test ...`. But I also add `Makefile` to make it easier for you to run them.
``` bash
$ make test-all # for running all the test
$ make test-1 # for running only the first problem
$ make test-2 # for running only the second problem
```
And the list goes on until problem no 6.
